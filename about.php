            <p>We are the founders of the Charity Brawl, a fun and competitive way for charities to fundraise without difficult or expensive overhead. Players compete to best one another and gain the top ranking on the charity event. Whoever has the highest rank when the charity event wins an award on thier page, and charities can even provide door prizes to top competitors.</p>
            <p>The Charity Brawl's focus is to make competitive gaming count for a good cause. By encouraging a competitive spirit that has raised money for-profit games, we can be able to harness a crowdsourced game in order to raise large amounts of funds for charities in need.</p>
